        I am a 17 year old student interested in programming. <br>
        This is my attempt to make a WebSite from scratch using HTML and CSS. <br><br>
        In the future this is going to be a place where I post my projects and my thoughts. A place where you can get to
        know me and where we can get in touch.
        <br><br>
        As a student, I don't know a lot about coding, but I am striving to learn every day. It is going to be an
        exciting journey.<br><br>

        <div class="titles">Past</div>
        Originally I was born in a city named Ferizaj, in Kosovo.<br>
        At a really young age I moved from a small town in Kosovo to Italy and went immediately into an italian
        kindergarten and an elementary school after that.<br>
        We moved twice again after moving to italy.<br>
        Growing up I used to be fascinated of my big brothers coding skills, who is an fullstack web developer.<br>
        I was always illuminated by the huge selection programming has.<br>
        Since two years now I started involving myself in programming, I am learning really fast and my
        progress is huge.<br>
      </div>

      <div id="webInfoP" class='myParagraphs'>
        <h2>WebInfo</h2>
        Time needed for whole Website: > 15h <br>
        Time where I got help: > 2h <br>
        Ideas & design: by me <br>
      </div>

      <div id="presentP" class='myParagraphs'>
        <div class="titles">Present</div>
        My first projects were old 2D Games programmed with HTML like Snake, Breakout or Ping Pong.<br>
        After I realized that game development isn't really in my interests, I started exploring CSS and trying it
        out.<br>
        Currently I am trying to find something which can give me the chance to learn an language at perfection. <br>
      </div>
      <div id="futureP" class='myParagraphs'>
        <div class="titles">Future</div>
        For my future I got big goals but to reach them I need to make little steps.<br>
        I want to know how to code with JavaScript, HTML and CSS for web development and other languages for Software
        engineering.<br>
        I also want to see how it is to work with a professional team on a bigger project than my own.<br>
        But at the end of the day my main goal is to hopefully work with capable kind people who share the same
        interests like me, coding.<br>
      </div>
      <div id="projectsP" class='myParagraphs'>
        <div class="titles">Projects</div>
        So this are some projects I made over the last couple years. <br>
        But remember some of this projects were just some help to get started. <br>
        Some are just some chaotic games, which I made by watching YouTube-Tutorials step by step. <br>

    <h2>Eri´s PingPong</h2>
    So this one is pne of the first Projects I ever made. <br>
    I remember struggling really hard for this one. <br>
    After I was done with the tutorial and had some code nothing was really fully functioning. <br>
    So I called my brother who helped me and debugged the whole thing while he explained me everything. <br>
    So here you can try it out and play with your mates. <br>
    But remember this one you can only play, if you are looking up my WebSite on your Laptop or Computer. <br>

    <h3>Eri´s Doodlejump</h3>
    This one was made right after the PingPong. <br>
    The goal of my projects wa only to learn how to code. <br>
    I was interested in web development and in game development. <br>
    So I tried to make so many games as possible which everyone can play for free on a browser. <br>
    I gave up after making my last game called Starman. <br>
    My interest in game development faded, so I really just coded random websites. <br>
    Sadly at that age I wasn`t organized at all and lost almost every project after my laptop never turned on again.
    <br>
    Thats where I got to know what a cloud is. <br>

  <h2>Eri`s Oldschool-Snake</h2>
  So this is my secon favorite game that I made. <br>
  I was really statisfied when I finished this one. <br> 
  I made it watching a tutorial like PingPong and DoodleJump. <br>

  <h2>Starman!</h2>
  Starman was my own idea. 
  It was the peak of my gamedevelopment-era, but I needed help to make this one. 
  I asked my brother if he was interested in working on this project with me and he was. 
  He suggested to use godot, which is a free Game-Engine. 
  I had the idea to make it the way it is, but even for two motivated developers we needed time to do this one. 
  The game was never finishe because of the lack of energy of both of us. 
  Remember this one you can play on your laptop. 
  You have to install it to try it out, but you can also install it and send the file to your phone. 
  If you have a android it won´t be a problem. 
  The game got three levels, please don´t get angry the last one is impossible. 
  <br>
  <img src="/assets/starman1-b8c8231b.png" class="starmanPic">
  <br>
  I am going to add here a file which you can install to try out my game. 
  Me personally would recommend installing it on the phone so you have a better gaming experience. 
  Before you install it you have to know you will get some warnings about unkown risks by installing the game. 
  You´ll have to trust the project to try it out. I have it myself on my phone. 
  So here you have the file:
